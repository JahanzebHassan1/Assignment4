too  like the suspension i must quote is way better than that of vezel but the acceleration wise vezel takes the lead and that however is because of that car being a hybrid equipped  fuel economy is

pretty quiet  suspension is hard  but that gives you the advantage of good braking and good handling final words  it is for sure a lovable car  you can really feel the thrust with which the car moves when you push the accelerator all the way down  one reviewer mentioned that the car doesn t move above 120kmph but this is because he couldn t really push the accelerator further down  i m not sure whether this is a feature or not but accelerator pushes very easily until a point  beyond that point you need to press it quite harder and that is the point when the car actually goes above 120kmph

was used in potohars back in 1980 s with minor tweaks for cng and fuel consumption  over the passage of time suzuki has hardly made any interior/exterior change  car prices are constantly rising and its price started around 5 lacs is not at 8 21 000 rs which is not worth the product and you may opt for imported car in this range and even lower the handling is a nightmare on its stock tyres  and the car is also extremely stiff and bumpy  so changing to softer and wider tyres is recommended  which will make a lot of difference in its comfort and grip  the car will handle fine till 80kms  above that and you will feel like losing it  it comes with hydraulic steering system which is acceptable for the reason that eps at high speeds due to high steering sensitivity will become a risk interior wise this car has sub standard build quality and squeaks from a new car are nothing new  recently they changed the traditional cassette player to jvc cd/mp3 player  the seats are a little uncomfortable specially while turning when the body roll takes over and you literally start moving to the sides  the a/c works just fine if not good exterior wise the looks still come from the 90 s and nothing has been upgraded  it even does not have rear screen defrostthe positive point is its spare parts  they are as cheap as anything and you can get them from almost everywhere at some serious cheap price  so driving in traffic takes the edge off you economy on cng is around 4rs/litre while on petrol with a/c  local it would hardly give you 12km  on long route it increases to 14km/l which is still not acceptable for 1000cc carby engine this cars engine has been discontinued worldwide and recently this model was taken off the chart from suzuki pakistan                     more

a car for myself  it could have been anything gli  city  vitz  belta  basicly anything with a small engine   d   so after much thought i went for the suzuki swift  i had never driven it before  and sat in it once when it was newly launched  when i picked it from the showroom i was expecting it to be a typical suzuki  but was in for a surprise  the 1 3 dohc is one mean machine  the power delivery is big  it simply goes crazy   i agree its not like gli in terms of fuel consumption but it covers that with the fun factor when u floor the pedal   d   the abs does what it is supposed to do  the breaks are responsive  the ride compared to the city is much better  city is known for its hard seats  but the swift is comfortable on long drives and on bumpy roads          when one thinks about suzuki the word bad quality instantly comes to ones head  but in the swift its diffrent   the build quality is impressive  suzuki has left no loose ends  both from the inside and out  the air conditioning is as they say chillling  d  the leg rooom happens to be excellent for a person of good build and height i e 6foot and 80kgs          people may say that 12 lakhs is too much for a suzuki or rather a small car  but the thing is its not a small car  its a hatchback     what car gives u alloy rims  keyless entry  fog lamps  power windows and adjustable sideview mirrors in 12 lakhs and that to zero meter  the tires supplied by suzuki are good bridgestones  not the euro star that come with honda and toyota  a good stereo supplied by alpine which complements the whole dashboard and completes its look  impressive  no          you the reader might say im going on showering praises on the car cause i own it myself  no thats not the case   im telling from experience as i have owned or happend to drive its competitors and yes the swift has its flaws  its heavy on fuel  but it does give 11km/l and above with normal city driving  and i happend to notice it does have understeer  maybe its the way i drive but it does tend to messup a bit in the corners  another flaw i noticed is that the car is low  when at full capacity driver has to be carefull on the speed breakers  the resale value on the other hand is considerd to be low when taking into account other cars       thats about everything i have to say about the car  in looks its small   drives like a big car and goes like one aswel   i personaly do not promote rash driving but in times of need or emergncy the swift is perfectly capable of doing 170km/h on the moterway   tried and tested to 175km/h  i hope my

fact i learned driving using this vehicle    firstly lets get to the basics  the price  currently its a bit overpriced  though i would still go for it as a family 7 seater over any jeep/vehicle in this price range  comfort  to be honest for an imported vehicle its not the most comfortable car  though i have seen worse  much better than many pakistani cars/vans   and it has lots of space    that s all that matters  i guess   consumption  on cng its fairly cheap  specially on long drives  on petrol its a bit expensive cause of the extra power due to the weight  but i d prefer driving it on petrol all the time as its totally at a different comfort level on petrol   though i don t pay for either  so i guess my opinion doesn t matter  my dad pays and he says its good on cng  p   now to the other things that matter  power  it has lots of power  the 1 5l engine is just about the right size for this vehicle  safety  here is where the apv looses most of its points  it has no abs  that really is the worst part  no airbags  the tires  play an important role in keeping the car stable  if you change them to bigger ones  you might increase the comfort but decrease the stability  its fairly stable  as a teenager like me hasn t killed himself yet  using the vehicle  so its stable till that extent  though after a few years it will be very risky to drive it over 120 km/h on the motorway or anywhere for that matter  as it wobbles  and feels very unsafe  practicality  it is the best car in this section  it has lots of space for any type of luggage   though the cng cylinder does take a bit of space in the back  there is still room to put two big bags behind the rear seats  you can easily fit 10 people in it  though the people at the back will be a bit squeezed  add one of those roofs to it and your luggage problem for these ten people is solved   if each person has a bag   overall  it is one of the best cars/vans i ve seen in pakistan  and in this price range any other vehicle of it s type can not compete with it  though if you can manage the cost of fuel  i d suggest getting a prado or pajero   as they are more fun to drive and has way more power plus comfort  only problem would be they d be old and the apv would be brand new                      more                                    less                    ', '  sir  in that case and according pama

from their selling ratio  you compare them from their performance  value for money and services given in them  now why toyota has more sales  look first of all i don t think that anybody rational would say that liana is better than corrolla that s a fact whether anybody admits it or not  and selling of more units is because of having the great reselling price and most of all the durability

also running in some countries like saudi arabia etc   but not with this engine  also this car in those countries has  not permission to come on motorways it is due to this reason that some people

it for 507 000 n the mehran was a mere 1 lac cheaper  suspension is good n srt of corollaish  its a great car in its category for use in pakistan  done almost 67000 kms fault free  gives excellent fuel economyon cng  has given me over 240 kms on a tank full many a times without ac on long routes despite having 165 yokohamas 707 which are great n replaced with the same tyre at 58000  costs between 2 3 rs / km nowadays with ac n mixed locak n highway driving  rear  headlights are expensive and so are the engine parts  but aval of cheaper chinese parts does the job  itts my daily ride n love her to bits  the pickis great  the key to the great performance is regular maintenance of the car n using quality engine oil n filters at regulatr interval with period maint done on time  the worst part is its fuel economy on petrol which is worst than my 1 8 civic prosmatec overall i give it a 7/10                       more                                    less                    ', ' i have a 2005 model vxr  it s economical and quite nice car  it has fuel economy on cng  and it gave me almost 120kms  i loved this car overall  its a great pack of luxury  comfort  safety  i would give it 6/10 and it still needs improvement in quality  durability   ', ' what the hell     i think pak suzuki has gone mad  its a stupid car in 750 thousands  i would prefer a used toyota corolla or honda civic instead of new suzuki alto or even liana suzuki should review their price list again  other than companies one will never buy a 8 lac in total  suzuki alto  ', ' this is really a joke for me that alto going at a price of 750 even without registration and without all those matts and other things that are included in a normal car i had been using mehran and you really have to be carefull in order to keep it in good condition  it is such a abnormal rate by an abnormal company suzuki   ']\n"
